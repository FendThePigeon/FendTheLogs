There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

"51192","","6.4","Medium","dc01","tcp","636","SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted","The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.","The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    open-source libjpeg image processing library due to
    improper handling of objects in memory. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    disclose sensitive information that can be utilized to
    bypass ASLR security protections. (CVE-2013-6629)

  - Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist in
    the win32k component due to improper handling of kernel
    information. A local attacker can exploit these
    vulnerabilities, via a specially crafted application, to
    disclose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-0058,
    CVE-2017-0188)

  - A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the
    Microsoft Graphics Component due to improper handling of
    objects in memory. A local attacker can exploit this,
    via a specially crafted application, to execute
    arbitrary code with elevated privileges. (CVE-2017-0156)

  - A flaw exists in the VBScript engine due to improper
    handling of objects in memory. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this, by convincing a user
    to visit a malicious website or open a specially crafted
    document file, to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2017-0158)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in ADFS
    due to incorrectly treating requests from Extranet
    clients as Intranet requests. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this to bypass account lockout
    protection mechanisms and more easily gain access to a
    user's account via a brute-force attack. (CVE-2017-0159)

  - Multiple flaws exist in Windows Hyper-V Network Switch
    due to improper validation of input from the guest
    operating system. A local attacker can exploit these,

    improper handling of objects in memory. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    disclose sensitive information that can be utilized to
    bypass ASLR security protections. (CVE-2013-6629)

  - Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist in
    the win32k component due to improper handling of kernel
    information. A local attacker can exploit these
    vulnerabilities, via a specially crafted application, to
    disclose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-0058,

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in ADFS
    due to incorrectly treating requests from Extranet
    clients as Intranet requests. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this to bypass account lockout
    protection mechanisms and more easily gain access to a
    user's account via a brute-force attack. (CVE-2017-0159)

  - Multiple flaws exist in Windows Hyper-V Network Switch
    due to improper validation of input from the guest

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out
